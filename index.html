        <p class="message">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

        <p class="message">Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to describe my feeling... For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products. I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius. </p>
